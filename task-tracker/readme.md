# Task Tracker

Sample solution for the [task-tracker](https://roadmap.sh/projects/task-tracker) challenge from [roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/).

This is a simple command-line interface (CLI) application for managing tasks.

## Features

- Add new tasks with a unique ID and store it in `JSON` format.
- List tasks by their status: `to-do`, `in-progress`, or `done`.
- Update the description of an existing task.
- Delete tasks by their ID.
- Mark tasks as `in-progress` or `done`.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your system.

   ```bash
   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/Aj-Seven/backend-projects

[
  {
    "id": 1,
